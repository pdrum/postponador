# Postponador

Postponador is a simple note-taking app that organizes your notes by date. Each note is associated with a specific day so you can easily review what was written on any given date.

## Features

- **Date-Based Notes:**  
  Select a date using the navigation arrows or date picker, and add notes that are tied to that day. The notes are displayed according to the date you choose.

- **Handwritten Style:**  
  The app uses a handwritten-style font and a clean design with soft pastel blue and green colors.

- **Note Management:**  
  Tap a note to mark it as done or tap the delete icon to remove it.

- **Go to Today:**  
  When you are not viewing todayâ€™s notes, a small control (a lightning icon followed by the word "Today") appears. Tap it to quickly return to today's notes.
